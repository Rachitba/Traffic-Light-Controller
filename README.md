Traffic Light Controller - FPGA (VHDL)
This project implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) to control a four-way junction traffic light system using VHDL. The design is deployed on the Nexys 4 DDR FPGA board.

Implementation
This FSM manages traffic lights at a four-way junction, ensuring smooth traffic movement by allowing only one direction to proceed at a time. The system follows a predefined sequence that prevents collisions and optimizes traffic flow.

Features
Four traffic light signals controlling a highway intersection,
Proper sequencing of Red, Yellow, and Green lights for safe traffic flow,
Reset functionality using a switch,
Synchronized timing and state transitions.

Hardware & Tools
FPGA Board: Nexys 4 DDR,
HDL Language: VHDL,
Development Environment: Vivado
